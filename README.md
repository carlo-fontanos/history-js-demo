# Using History.js with AJAX

Over the past decade, web applications have evolved to make heavy use of JavaScript in order to dynamically load content into web pages. One of the big challenges that developers face when creating these applications is preserving an accurate and useful browser history. Without this many of a browsers most used features, like the back and forward buttons, will not work as expected.

## Aim
+ To store a history of every dynamically loaded pages.
+ To load dynamic contents base on the URL inputted / pasted directly into the brower’s URL bar.
+ To make the browser’s forward and backward buttons work.
+ To enable sharing of URLs or use them to create links from any HTML document.
+ History.JS currently supports a lot of JavaScript libraries, but for this example I will only be demonstrating how to use the jQuery version of History.JS in working with dynamic contents.
